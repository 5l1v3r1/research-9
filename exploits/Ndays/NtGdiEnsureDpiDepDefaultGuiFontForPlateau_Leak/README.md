# NtGdiEnsureDpiDepDefaultGuiFontForPlateau Information Leak
#### Affects: Windows 10 version 1709 to 1903
#### CVE: Unknown (silently patched)

Exploit has been tested against Windows 10 x64 version 1903 with win32kfull.sys version 10.0.18362.449 (October 2019 patches applied). The exploit should run normally if you create a new Console Project in Visual Studio Community 2019 and copy and paste the code into main.cpp. Running the exploit on vulnerable systems will cause the win32kbase!gahDpiDepDefaultGuiFonts pointer to be leaked, which will then be utilizied to calculate the base address of win32kbase.sys.
